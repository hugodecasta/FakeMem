# Project example notebook
### This notebook is here to investigate the research litterature in order tot guide someone in creating a state of the art corpus and gain knowledge in the researched field.

## Problem definition

Remember that this problem definition is only the first one. Later in your project and while you are investigating the your reserach field the problem definition will be modified, augmented or completly altered.

 * ### What do you want ?
   * Play with little simple robot so they can do things
   * Want system to analyse their environment to create a behavior
   * I want this behavior to be surprising and maybe helpful
 * ### What do you thinck you need ?
   * I will need to let interact the system with its environment
   * Need to analyse sequences to understand fundamental link between it's elements.
   * Create memory model based on relationship between events so the associations can be analysed as a sequence (maybe)
   * The main problem will be association. How to make association between events with their different properties (emotion, location, colors, etc.)
   * recent Psychology / Cognition work on how memory works..
 * ### Define the problem now !
   Build a fundamental memory model to drive reinforcement learning and behavior building.

Using this thincking approach (and write your ideas) will make you see clearly and even re-thinck about your first view of the problem.

## First investigation loop

This loop is your corpus making loop, it will help you find references and detail your problem over and over again.

### keywords
from your problem definition and other thoughts, establish a general keywords list that you will look for in specialized journals.

### Paper retrieval / sorting
While selecting papers, you should look at the title and abstract to sort relevant papers. The amount of paper dependant on your project type
 * 20 papers for master project
 * 50 papers for thesis project

(It is possible that this phase needs a pdf retrieval step in which you make sure you get all pdf files)

### Pre-reading
A pre reading phase let you decide which papers are more relevant and sort very important papers. You should read only Abstracts, Intros and Conclusions (and walk through section titles). Once read, some papers will be removed from the corpus and other kept to augment / detail the keywords list. Next a more detailed keyword / paper organisation is needed. 

Sometimes only chapter titles can lead to an article selection and even "very importanting". Be careful of the date, if too old maybe remove the article (unless the article is cononical in the discipline).

By reading abstract/intro/conclusion it can appear that more important canonical article can be added to the corpus.
